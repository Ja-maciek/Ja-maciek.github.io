            <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        </br>
        • <i>Slide 1</i>: How many of you have at any point in the past experienced a moment of
        lack of motivation or prolonged procrastination
        </br>
                ▪ (most of the room expected to raise their hands)
        </br>
                ▪ I ask this question, but unfortunately, I know the answer. Taking into account the people that weren’t listening or simply didn’t care to raise their hand, I can imagine all of you have experienced this to some degree. Some more severely than others, some longer than others, but everyone has experienced this in some way.
        </br>
            ▪ A common misconception is that all demotivation and procrastination is laziness. Most people after telling someone about their lack of motivation to work would be told to stop being lazy and get to work
        </br>
                ▪ I’m not saying laziness doesn’t exist, but maybe you aren’t lazy. Maybe you are burnt out
        </br></br>
        <h1>Body:</h1>
        </br>
        • Around 7 years ago I started watching Mark Rober, an ex-NASA engineer, turned science youtuber whose sole purpose was to educate through online entertainment
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 2</i>: And In 2018 in a TED talk titled <i>“The super Mario effect”</i> he addressed just that. His incredible speech completely changed my perception of the system of education we have today
        </br>
        • Slide 3: In this TED talk he conducted two versions of a short experiment where using a simple programming language called Scratch you were supposed to guide the car to the <i>“Win”</i> box.
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 4</i>: Version 1: You started off with 200 points and each time you failed to guide the car to the destination you were met with this message and lost 5 points. 5 completely useless virtual internet points
        </br>
                ▪ Keep in mind these points mean nothing, completely virtual internet points that don’t impact your career, choices or anything remotely important in life
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 5</i>: And in Version 2, you still started with 200 points, but if you failed the only message you would see is, <i>“That didn’t work. Please try again”</i>
        </br>
                ▪ The only time the points would change, is when you got it right. Nothing happened if you got it wrong.
        </br>
        • Even though the experiments barely differed, the results were drastically different.
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 6</i> Notice how the version with a penalty had only a 52% success rate and people tended to give up much faster
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 7</i> The version of the experiment with no penalty had a higher success rate as well as more than twice the amount of tries
        </br>
        • The system of education we have in most highly developed countries is version 1. Just change the meaningless points to grades that impact your self-esteem and your nearest future, change the simple programming experiment to a 12 year long, tedious process involving crushed dreams, stupid amounts of pressure and unfulfilled ambitions. And you’ve got your average school experience
        </br>
            ▪ This all started when 2 years ago I transitioned into high school
        </br>
                ▪ When I lived in Toruń, In the 8<sup>th</sup> grade I loved math and all science subjects. I had pretty good overall scores, but clearly, I was best at sciences. So, in my freshman year of high school, or 1<sup>st</sup> grade of high school I decided to take one of the most demanding math classes in my city. Something I knew would take a lot of work, but I thought I was ready. I was all cocky and sure of myself after having done so well in 8<sup>th</sup> grade I thought I could take on the world. But that quickly changed once I got my first grades. A few bad grades in and I realized <i>“Well, maybe I wasn’t cut out for this”</i>. To be fair I didn’t spend all of first grade studying, I did my fair share of procrastinating, and disregarding my responsibilities. However, after learning my mistake, in 2<sup>nd</sup> grade I started to really try my hardest. It’s one thing to get bad results when putting in minimal effort, but to get the same results when doing your best is something absolutely devastating. Couple that with a class and teachers that hate you, minimal sleep, and my fair share of unfortunate circumstances. You get, burnout. After some time trying my hardest regardless of how I was feeling, I realized not only was I getting nowhere, but I started dreading that, which I once loved. In the last 5-6 months of 2<sup>nd</sup> grade, getting out of bed was a success. Getting any productive studying done, even 30 minutes, was a success. No other subject concerned me anymore since I was getting acceptable grades from them without studying. Math became my life’s only focus. The last 3 months between March and June were excruciating. My average was 1.7 which was not passing the class at the time and no matter what I did, I couldn’t get a good grade. Normally in this kind of scenario, the teacher of your subject comes to help you and encourage you, however I didn’t have that luxury at the time. Due to my teacher’s high ambitions and reputation, a distaste started forming in her mouth for me, and those who weren’t math prodigies. I found myself begging to be let through to the next class promising I wouldn’t return to her lessons, and she would have me out of her hair never to lower her average again. But that couldn’t cut it. Finally on a technicality on the happiest day of my life in early June, I passed the class never to see that teacher again. A subject that once was my pride and joy, due to a change of curriculum and teacher, turned into something I never wanted to have anything to do with again. (MAKE SURE TO EXPLAIN THIS WASN’T 1LO)
        </br>
        • If anyone is confused about what burnout is and what its symptoms are, here (<i>Slide 8</i>) are some examples of symptoms often found in people suffering from being burnt out
        </br>
            ▪ Burnout usually starts with a prolonged time in which you feel like the time you spend every day on work that you find mundane or dull is underappreciated
        </br>
            ▪ Which is followed by
        </br>
                ▪ Sense of failure and self-doubt
        </br>
                ▪ Loss of motivation
        </br>
                ▪ Increasingly cynical and negative outlook on the world
        </br>
                ▪ Hatred towards that, which once was a highlight of your day
        </br>
            ▪ You may start wanting to take your frustrations out on others, isolating yourself. Maybe even procrastinating so long to the point where you might even withdraw from certain responsibilities
        </br>
        • And don’t think this is something that only concerns you. Burning yourself out is something normalized or at times even encouraged by our bosses or even sometimes colleagues.
        </br>
            ▪ If you don’t believe that, think about all the times you’ve found yourself in a conversation where people try to one-up themselves in degrading or unhealthy activities for example:
        </br>
                ▪ You’re sitting at a table with a friend of yours during a long month at work or school. You say you only got 4 hours of sleep, a friend of yours says <i>“Wow, you must be well rested then, I only got 2”</i>. At which point a colleague no one really talks to comes in with a triple-espresso in one hand, and a can of Red-Bull in the other saying he hasn’t slept in days
        </br>
                ▪ Instead of discouraging this kind of behavior and saying it’s unhealthy. We tend to try to one-up each other trying to see who has the worst circumstances and most unhealthy way of living
        </br>
        • It’s something so engrained in our society, certain cultures have even adapted their language to it
        </br>
            ▪ Since the oil crisis of 1973, the Japanese culture shifted from normal hours of work, to perceiving working over 70 hours a week as something normal and even honorable.
        </br>
            ▪ On May 17<sup>th</sup>, 2021, the WHO <i>Slide 9</i> (World Health Organization) wrote an article stating that long working hours, so over 55 hours a week, can cause premature death.
        </br>
                ▪ They found that in 2016, 398 000 people died from stroke and 347 000 died from heart disease as a result of having worked at least 55 hours a week. Between the year 2000 and 2016 the number of deaths from heart disease due to long work hours increased by 42%, and from stroke, by 19%
        </br>
            ▪ This new take started with the COVID-19 pandemic, when certain jobs were moved from office work, to working from home. Something that, if overdone, can be a serious detriment to mental health due to blurring the lines between work, and home.
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 10</i> Japan realized this much earlier than the WHO organization, and have a dedicated word for it: <i>Karoshi (過労死)</i>, meaning “death from overworking”
        </br>
        • This isn’t a lost cause. The Finnish system of education is regarded by many people to be the most efficient way to teach, despite lacking simple things such as a standardized grading system. <i>Slide 11</i> This is a real-life example of the effectiveness of version 2
        </br>
            ▪ <i>Slide 12</i> The Finnish system of education prioritizes basics. Rather than focusing on increasing test scores or dominating other countries or schools, the Finnish system of education focuses on creating a healthy lifestyle for students and even teachers.
        </br>
                ▪ Students oftentimes don’t have any homework at all. They start school between 8 and 9 AM and finish by 2pm. They are also graded individually with a grading system set by their teacher. Efficiently implementing version 2 of the experiment per student.
        </br>
                ▪ Teachers have the same status as doctors and lawyers, which increases the quality of people teaching and raising the next generation. As well as properly rewarding teachers for their work. A teacher can make or break a student. One person has the power to either inspire tens or hundreds of people to love and admire a certain subject they once hated, or discourage all hopes of success with that subject
        </br>
                    • Imagine the kind of results we would have, if being a teacher was reserved to those with a passion for teaching.
        </br>

        <h3>REFERENCE BEING SCARED TO ADAM’S TED TALK</h3>
        </br>
        </br>
        <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
        </br>
        • <i>Slide 13</i>: So, unless you’re in the Finnish system of education, have your dream job, or are simply retired, what can you do to prevent this from happening? This is not a list in which you can choose one option to prevent it, it’s a list that requires you to fulfill each one of these points to effectively prevent burnout from happening.
        </br>
            1. <i>Slide 14</i>: Figure out what it is that’s causing you to start burning out
        </br>
                ▪ While it may seem obvious, identifying exactly what is causing you trouble can help with time management, and preparing yourself mentally to that aspect of life.
        </br>
            2. <i>Slide 15</i>: Get enough sleep
        </br>
                ▪ Don’t sleep less than 7 hours for a long period of time. Sleeping 4 or 5 hours because you have to make up for lost time, or because of a crunch time at work is fine as long as it doesn’t last more than a couple nights. 7 hours of sleep is the minimum for adults, and if you’re a child between 13 and 18, 9 hours is the minimum
        </br>
            3. <i>Slide 16</i>: Exercise regularly
        </br>
                ▪ I don’t mean your daily walk to the bus stop and back. Make sure to have time on a slower day, or on the weekends for some exercise.
        </br>
            4. <i>Slide 17</i>: Eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. Don’t just live off frozen pizza everyday
        </br>
            5. <i>Slide 18</i>: Dedicate some time EVERY DAY to a hobby of any kind. Ideally something that can give you a change of setting
        </br>
            6. <i>Slide 19</i>: Realistically manage your time
        </br>
                ▪ Don’t underestimate how long a project may take, and eventually panic when you don’t meet a predetermined deadline, forcing yourself into more crunch time. Set a realistic deadline that gives you buffer room for errors, mistakes, and setbacks
        </br>
            7. <i>Slide 20</i>: Find what works best for you. No job, project, or grade is worth sacrificing your mental health for. It’s much easier to prevent something from happening, than to reverse its consequences
        </br>
            8. <i>Slide 21</i>: Lastly, I would like to mention fear, something that my friend Adam already spoke about and neatly ties into what I have to say today
        </br>
                ▪ (<i>That didn’t work, please try again</i> slide)
        </br>
                    • Version 1, so the version most education systems use, is a simple example of fear. You start trying to do things better in order to not get this punishment of these 5 points. Yet while pushing yourself you start spending more time, and instead of focusing on the end goal of what you’re doing, you instead focus on the consequences if you don’t do them. This slide here is the reason burnout is so common. Version 1 will always be around whether we like it or not, because not having consequences for our actions is a world of anarchy. But we can lower the severity of these consequences and it is up to you to do the rest. Instead of focusing on what you haven’t done and what will happen because you did it incorrectly, focus on what you’ve learned from this mistake and keep going.
